# Deep Dive into Stanford’s CS231n: Where Computer Vision and Neural Networks Come to Life

Embarking on Stanford's CS231n journey has been, in a word, exhilarating. This course covers everything from the basics to the intricate details of computer vision. If you’re interested in understanding what goes into training AI to "see," then this course is like gold!


As I walk through each assignment, I’ll be sharing insights, tips, and "aha" moments. It’s definitely not a breeze – the concepts are intense – but seeing progress is worth every struggle. From feature mapping to the complexities of convolutional layers, I’ll highlight key learnings so you can join in the journey.


Follow along in my Medium articles as I break down each milestone. It’s a mix of fun discoveries, real challenges, and practical steps I’m taking to build a solid computer vision foundation. You can find my latest updates here: Medium Link.
